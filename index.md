# John Hopkins Database COVID-19 Analysis

With the high tensions around the COVID-19 and contradicting conclusions of the data coming from various sources, I decided to do my own analysis of the highly valued John Hopkins database to come to more understanding of the pandemic.

## Data Description

Please reference the data descriptions page for an in-depth summary of the data used in this project.

The John Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 dashboard is a highly reguarded data tracking project that has been used as arguably the standard as the COVID-19 data analysis source. In this project, I use the data along with population numbers from the United States Census Bureau & various other government sources to understand the relation between the pandemic and international populations. I use temperature as another factor in the U.S. analysis
